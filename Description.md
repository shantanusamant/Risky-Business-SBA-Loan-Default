#Data Sources 
1.   SBANational.csv: This is a loan dataset from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). 

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) was established in 1953 with the goal of promoting and supporting small enterprises in the U.S. credit market. Small businesses are essential for job creation and reducing unemployment, making it important to foster their growth. The SBA has helped many start-ups with loan guarantees, including well-known companies such as FedEx and Apple. However, some small businesses and start-ups have failed to repay their SBA-guaranteed loans, resulting in default.

2.   uszips.csv: uszips.csv is a dataset containing information about zip codes in the United States. 

The dataset includes 15 columns of information, such as the zip code, the latitude and longitude of the center of the zip code area, the city and state associated with the zip code, and the population and density of the zip code area. Additionally, the dataset includes information about the ZCTA (Zip Code Tabulation Area) associated with the zip code and any parent ZCTA. This dataset could be useful for a variety of applications, such as analyzing demographic data or mapping geographic regions based on zip codes.
